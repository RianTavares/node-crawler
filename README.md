- [✓] Formats the response to Json
- [✓] Test coverage (using JEST)
- [✓] "Dockerized"
- [✓] Implemented as a Webservice for test environments

## Fast setup (CLI Version)

1. Download or Clone the project and extract it
2. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) and install it.
3. Run `npm install` in `node-crawler` folder
4. Start the bot via command line `node ./src/app.js`
5. The project now is running on `3000` port. In the next topic you can see how to login and get a response from the API

#### How to login and run the bot

This project has a database simulated in a js file `/src/models/dbSimulator.js`, because the intention is to do a login validation for a test enviroment and it will just works if there is only single entries into `dbSimulator.js`

1. Download [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and install it
2. With the API running just do a `POST` request with the URL `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/login`
3. Remember to pass username:`root` and password:`123` into the body of this request
4. Copy the request response
5. Open a `GET` request with the URL `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/info` and choose the tab "Authorization" with the type `Bearer Token`
6. Then paste the request response previously copied in step 4 into "Token" input and send the request

#### Run the project using container

Dockerfile:
```docker
FROM node:8
WORKDIR /docker/src/app/
COPY package.json /docker/src/app/
RUN npm install
COPY . /docker/src/app/
CMD node ./src/app.js
EXPOSE 3002
```
1. First [Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) docker and let it [running](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#test-docker-installation)
2. Into the project folder `node-crawler` run the command `docker build -t node-crawler .`  to create the docker image
3. Then run `docker run -p 3002:3000 node-crawler`
4. run `docker ps` if you want to see the containers started
5. Now  with the API running into the container just do a `POST` request with the URL `http://localhost:3002/api/v1/login`
6. Remember that as configured in Dockerfile the port now is `3002`
7. Don't forget to pass username:`root` and password:`123` into the body of this request
8. Copy the request response
9. Open a `GET` request with the URL `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/info` and choose the tab "Authorization" with the type `Bearer Token`
10. Then paste the request response previously copied in step 7 into "Token" input and send the request
